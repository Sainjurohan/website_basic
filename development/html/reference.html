			<p>Amazon is one of the best online shopping platforms. Thus, it was taken as an inspiration in the
				development of our e-commerce website. The product display categories were taken into consideration and
				displayed accordingly. Specifically, the internal navigation using # reference (i.e. #id-of-element)
				used in the page was implemented in our project to navigate to the top of the page from within the page.

			<p>W3 Schools is one of the best platforms to learn the basics of Markup and scripting

				website. The reference was implemented in our project as per the requirement and needs to ease
				navigation between the pages.

			<p>GeeksForGeeks is one of the pioneer platforms for learning programming languages. We also got some

			<p>addtocart.co.uk is one of the online shopping platforms which sells quality goods. The cart feature of
				this website was quite eye-catching. Thus, the cart feature in our website was implemented inspired by
				the cart feature of the website. In addition, many product displaying ideas were also considered to make
				our website the best version of itself. Also, increasing the values of quantity and total price of cart dynamically
				was also implemented.
